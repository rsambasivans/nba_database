Some feedback that our CA gave us after phase C and D was to add a few queries that were more complex including
some percentile based queries and some that involve some more joins in the actual sql queries. We adjusted the
queries we used in the final layout to address this feedback and we had our CA review the updated queries
to make sure that they're adequate. Specifically, we added around 5 queries that use percentile calculates to add
anoter layer of complexity.
